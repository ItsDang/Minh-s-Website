						Tragedy Strikes at Mount Rushmore.
					</p>
					<p id="summary">
						&apos;Lena Dunham faced certain death earlier this month when she visited South Dakota. Dunham, who rose to fame in early 2013 for her uncanny resemblance to childhood icon &quot;;Little Critter&quot; and a loaf of wonder bread, recalls the traumatizing ordeal. 
						&quot;I was minding my own business and enjoying the views of the PoC Hills when I saw a group of men desecrating the cliff face. I told them that what they&apos;re doing was culturally insensitive and they then resorted to threats if I didn&apos;t leave them alone. They called me sexist and derogatory terms when I confronted them.&quot;
						The men reportedly called Dunham &quot;marshmallow&quot; and &quot;soggy bread&quot;. 
						When asked how she felt about the harrowing encounter, Dunham stated that 
						&quot;I was shocked and taken back, this is the 21st Century, don&apos;t they know who I am? I couldn&apos;t believe they thought they were allowed to say those things to someone as famous and rich as I am, or I think they did.&quot;
						The four men are currently being held by authorities.
